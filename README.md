The Wit Programming Language
============================

This is the reference implementation of the Wit Programming Language by Neil Madden.
Wit is an experimental programming language (i.e., don't use it!) exploring agent-oriented programming
(yet another "AOP") within the context of large-scale software development. The long term goal is to displace
Java EE as the primary choice for server-side "enterprise" application development.

Briefly, Wit can be described as a cross pollination of the following heritage:

  - a core statically typed functional programming language, based on ML and Haskell;
  - a statically typed relational/logical database language based on Datalog;
  - a BDI (belief-desire-intention) agent model based on the Procedural Reasoning System and AgentSpeak(L);
  - an goal-based programming model integrated with the above based on STRIPS planning;
  - a process model similar to Erlang, and a condition system similar to Common Lisp or Dylan;
  - a (hopefully) pleasing and clean syntax based on Python and ML.

As you can see, Wit owes a huge intellectual debt to many ancestors.

Warning: Wit is currently vapourware.
